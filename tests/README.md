// Screen Size 

In the playwright.config.js file, the viewport property expects the width and height values in pixels. Playwright uses pixel units to define viewport dimensions. So, when you specify the width and height, they should be in pixels.

If you need to work with dimensions in other units such as centimeters, you can calculate the equivalent pixel values based on the screen's pixel density (dots per inch or DPI). For example, if you know the DPI of the screen, you can convert centimeters to pixels using the formula:

Pixels = Centimeters × DPI × 1
                            2.54

Where DPI is dots per inch. Once you have the pixel values, you can use them to set the viewport size in Playwright.
